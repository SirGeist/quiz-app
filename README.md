# Tutorial Quiz Application for Learning Flutter & Dart


## Description

The tutorial consisted of learning and applying various basic flutter concepts. Using
the lectures, I create a simple quiz app that asks you various questions. The user will
need to select what they think the correct answer may be. A summary page will appear at
the end of the quiz displaying how many questions the user got correctly. If the user
chose the wrong answer, the question's index will be pink. If they answered correctly,
it will appear blue instead. You can also retake the quiz to get a better score!   

## Requirements for running the code

Flutter SDK Used: '>=3.0.5 <4.0.0'
Google Fonts Library: '^5.1.0'
